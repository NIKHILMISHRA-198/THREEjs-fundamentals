There are 4 Properties to transform Objects

*position
*scale
*rotation
*quaternion


To move objects,
Position.
*x
*y
*z


Object3D instances have lookAt(...) method which rotates the object so that its -z faces the target you provided
The target must be a Vector3

camera.lookAt(new THREE.Vector3(0,-1,0))



You can put objects inside groups and use position, rotation (or quaternion),  and scale on those groups
To do that, use the Group class\\\

//Animations//


The purpose of requestAnimationFrame is to call the function provided on the next requestAnimationFrame
We are going to call the same function on each new frame

create tick function and call its
In the function calll it again but using window.requestAnimationFrame(...)


const tick =() => {
    console.log('tick')
    window.requestAnimationFrame(tick)
}

tick()

We need to know how much time it's been since the last tick
Use Date.now()  to get the timestamp

const time  = Date.now()


instead of using time = Date.now()

another solution to it is a built in function in THREE.js i.e Clock

Instantiate a Clock and use its getElapsedTime() method
const clock = new THREE.clock()

const tick=  () => {
    const elapsedTime  = clock.getElapsedTime()

    //update Objects
    mesh.rotation.y = elapsedTime
    //
}


If you want to have more control, create tweens,  create timelines etc. use GSAP like libraries.
